# Lists in Python
# A built-in data type that stores set of values
# It can store elements of different types (integer, float, string, etc.)

marks = [87, 64, 33, 95, 76]
print(marks)
print(type(marks))
print(len(marks))

student = ["Karan", 85,"Delhi"] #student[0], student[1]..
print(student[0])
# Strings are immutable i.e. we can not change it after the assignment
# List are mutable in python i.e. we can change them at any time 
student[0] ="Arjun" #allowed in python
print(student)
# #marks[0], marks[1]..
# len(student) #returns length
